# Huge LED Clock
 Huge Seven Segment LED clock using Arduino

This is an old project that took quite a long time to figure out and build.
it is running a barebone Atmega328 chip with the Arduino bootloader
it makes use of Stanley Seow's project in the below link and Pauls 4 digit 7 segment shift register design

I had made a few adjustments in the circuit design to make a clock much larger and brighter, however I did come across a few complications.

sadly the clock is no longer in my possesion, so I am unable to use it as a guide to recall the complications and design modifications I made in order to get it to function correctly
I have built a minature version is which I have been tinkering with.
However, I have used EEPROM to store the alarm functions and would rather use something that does not have a limited write cycle, any suggestions would be appreciated.
I am looking at using a SD card reader to store alarm funtions and possibly alarm songs/tunes
