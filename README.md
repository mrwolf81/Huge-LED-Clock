# Huge-LED-Clock
 Huge LED clock using Arduino

This is an old project that took quite a long time to figure out and build.
it is running two barebone Atmega328 chips with the Arduino bootloader
it makes use of Stanley Seow's project in the below link and Pauls 4 digit 7 segment shift register design

I had made a few adjustments in the circuit design to make a clock much larger and brighter, however I did come across a few complications.

sadly the clock is no longer in my possesion, so I am unable to use it as a guide to recall the complications and design modifications I made in order to get it to function correctly
I have built a minature version is which I have been tinkering with.
I would like to add buttons to input time/date corrections and change alarms. however I am terrible at coding and cannot quite figure out how to do it.
the other addition would be a remote keypad to use as the input device, but i would rather figure out how and what Stanley's code is doing and how to add input functions first.
